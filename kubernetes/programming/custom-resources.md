## Using Custom Resources
Custom Resources (CR) is one of the central extension mechanisms used throughout the Kubernetes ecosystem. Custom resources are used for small, in-house configuration objects without any corresponding controller logicâ€”purely declaratively defined. CRs are stored in the same etcd instance as the main Kubernetes API resources and served by the same Kubernetes API server.
</br>A CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a Kubernetes resource itself. It describes the available CRs in the cluster.
